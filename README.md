# LDJAM#51 Every Ten Seconds
I didn't really get any time to start this project. In fact I only really got started midway through Saturday afternoon. I worked on it a couple of hours that day and did some work on the Sunday. The first commit is about as far as I got Sat/Sun. It's not much.

## The Game
The game is pretty much a retro remake of [Hover Bover by Llamasoft (Jeff Minter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Bovver). It doesn't have half the features of the original. But my excuse is I've only spent about a day on it ;)
